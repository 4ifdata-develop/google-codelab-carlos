## Part One
Good for beginners

### Completed - version 0.1
If you're new to Flutter, we recommend starting with one of the following codelabs:
Building your first Flutter app (workshop). An instructor-led version of our very popular "Write your first Flutter app" codelab (listed below).

### Completed - version 0.1
Your first Flutter app
Create a simple app that automatically generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine". This app is responsive and runs on mobile, desktop, and web. (This also replaces the previous "write your first Flutter app" for mobile, part 1 and part 2 codelabs.) 

### Completed - version 0.1
Write your first Flutter app on the web
Implement a simple web app in DartPad (no downloads required!) that displays a sign-in screen containing three text fields. As the user fills out the fields, a progress bar animates along the top of the sign-in area. This codelab is written specifically for the web, but if you have downloaded and configured Android and iOS tooling, the completed app works on Android and iOS devices, as well.
