# Codelab Training - by Google.
### Created and modified by Carlos Lopez to create a workshop repository for my own fox, who joined our development team.

## Part One

### Completed - version 0.1
Your first Flutter app: Create a simple app that automatically generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine". This app is responsive and runs on mobile, desktop, and web. (This also replaces the previous "write your first Flutter app" for mobile, part 1 and part 2 codelabs.) 

### Completed - version 0.1
Write your first Flutter app on the web
Implement a simple web app in DartPad (no downloads required!) that displays a sign-in screen containing three text fields. As the user fills out the fields, a progress bar animates along the top of the sign-in area. This codelab is written specifically for the web, but if you have downloaded and configured Android and iOS tooling, the completed app works on Android and iOS devices, as well.

## Part Two

### Completed - version 0.1
Records and Patterns in Dart 3, Discover Dart 3's new records and patterns features. Learn how you can use them in a Flutter app to help you write more readable and maintainable Dart code.
